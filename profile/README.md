# Lunarbit Studios
**We build weird stuff that somehow works**
Welcome to the GitHub home of **Lunarbit Studios**. We’re a small creative dev studio that likes experimenting, learning by building, and occasionally duct-taping ideas together until they work.
We jump between games, tools, systems, and whatever else catches our interest at the time.

## What we work on

Most of our projects fall into a few rough categories:

* Games and interactive experiences
* Developer tools and SDKs we use ourselves
* Web and backend systems
* Experiments, prototypes, and half-finished ideas

Not everything here is polished or complete. Some projects exist to test ideas, some turn into something bigger, and some get dropped.

---

## Ongoing systems and directions

These are longer-term things we’re actively building around:

* **LunarCore** — a shared SDK ecosystem (Minecraft, web, tooling, future engines)
* **StarScript** — a narrative and story system for branching, moddable storytelling
* **ARG and narrative systems** — mixing in-game stories with real-world elements

---

## Games and creative projects

Current focus:

* **Relics of the Starborne** — a narrative-driven project built around lore, exploration, and long-form progression
---

## Public repositories

Some of the public, usable projects in this org:

* Modrinth Auto Updater — automatic mod update tooling
* WXR-to-CSV — WXR export to CSV converter
* CSViewer — a lightweight viewer tool
* LunarCore (Node / Fabric / Quilt) — shared libraries and SDK foundations

You’ll also find templates, internal tooling, and experiments that may change or disappear.

---

## How we build

* Build first, clean up later
* Break things to understand them
* Reuse systems instead of rewriting everything
* Open-source when it’s useful
* Lore and tech are not separate

---

## That’s it

This org is a snapshot of what we’re currently interested in, not a finished product lineup. Things change, projects get scrapped, and ideas evolve.

Lunarbit Studios — weird ideas, working code.
